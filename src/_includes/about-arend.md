Arend implements a version of [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) with an interval type, which syntax is similar to [cubical type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cubical+type+theory).
This implies several nice properties of path types and allows for a simple and clean definition of higher inductive types (including recursive ones).
To learn more about homotopy features implemented in Arend, see [{{ include.place }}](/about/arend-features#homotopy-features).

Arend has a powerful class system, which supports [Haskell-style](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Classes_and_types) instance inference.
Class inheritance can be used to define various hierarchies of (algebraic) structures.
For a discussion of the class system, see [{{ include.place }}](/about/arend-features#class-system).
