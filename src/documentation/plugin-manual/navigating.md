# Go to declaration

# File structure
The File Structure view, accessible via **Alt+7**, (or **âŒ˜ 7** on MacOS) provides an overview of all namespaces, sections, and declarations within an Arend file. Clicking any entry in this view navigates directly to the corresponding location in the code.

# Breadcrumbs bar
When the text cursor is placed anywhere in an Arend file, IntelliJ IDEA displays a breadcrumbs bar at the bottom of the editor. 
This bar shows the file path, namespaces, sections, and the current declaration where the cursor is located. Clicking on any item in the breadcrumbs bar reveals a list of all related elements. For example, clicking on a declaration will display all other declarations within the same namespace. Selecting an entry navigates directly to the associated code or file.
