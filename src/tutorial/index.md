Arend language is based on homotopy type theory. For that reason, the most natural explanation for many language constructs in Arend,
including the very basic ones, would be in terms of notions from homotopy theory. However, it is also possible to abstract away from 
homotopical semantics and to consider the layer of Arend that corresponds simply to a variant of the classical Martin-Lof dependent
type theory. The latter view is taken in this tutorial for the initial exposition of the language in Part I, whereas homotopical semantics
together with some specific for this semantics elements of the language are discussed in Part II. 

The Part I is an introduction to the actual practices of working with dependent types in Arend. It contains
example-based Arend-specific exposition of efficient ways of working with propositions and proofs, inductive types, classes and records,
type universes, etc. We assume that the reader is familiar with related theoretical concepts, most importantly with Martin-Lof type theory
and Curry-Howard correspondence.

The Part II is a practical introduction to homotopy type theory in the context of Arend. This part of the tutorial is currently missing, it will
be uploaded in the nearest future. Themes discussed here include datatypes with conditions (higher inductive types) and homotopy levels of
universes.
